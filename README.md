# IoT-DASHBOAR
Develop an IoT system that collects data from various sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion) and sends it to a cloud-based platform like Azure or AWS. Use Node.js to handle data ingestion, and visualize the data in real-time on a dashboard built with React, Power BI, or Tableau. Implement alerting mechanisms and historical data analysis.
